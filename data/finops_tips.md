FinOps Best Practices: A Quick Guide to Cloud Cost Management
1. Tagging and Cost Attribution
Why it matters: Good tagging is the foundation of FinOps. It allows you to attribute costs to the correct teams, projects, and environments.

Rule of thumb: Every resource should have a minimum of three tags: owner, environment, and project.

Finding gaps: Regularly check for resources with missing or inconsistent tags.

2. Right-Sizing and Waste Reduction
Concept: Right-sizing means matching your instance size or resource type to its actual usage needs.

Common offenders: Idle compute instances (VMs, containers), unused storage volumes, or over-provisioned databases.

Action: Use monitoring tools to identify resources with low CPU or memory utilization and downsize them to a more appropriate, less expensive tier.

3. Reserved Instances & Savings Plans
Purpose: Committing to a 1-year or 3-year term for a specific amount of compute usage can lead to significant discounts (up to 70%).

When to use: Ideal for predictable, long-running workloads, such as production servers or core database services.

4. Automation for Cost Governance
Automate everything: Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to enforce tagging policies and automatically shut down non-production resources after hours.

Example: A simple script can terminate all dev and staging resources at 7 PM to prevent overnight costs.

5. Budgeting and Alerts
Set thresholds: Define clear budget thresholds for accounts, teams, or services.

Alerting: Configure alerts that notify the relevant stakeholders when spending exceeds a certain percentage of the budget, preventing surprises at the end of the month.
